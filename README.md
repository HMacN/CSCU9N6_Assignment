# CSCU9N6_Assignment
A computer game made using the University of Stirling Java Game Library.  This formed the basis of the CSCU9N6 Game Development module assessment.

While the game itself has a few non-trivial bugs (notably with the physics engine), I still got a fairly good grade for the class.  The lecturer was kind enough to write on the report that "the quality of the delivered game does not adequately reflect the elegance of the underlying code".
